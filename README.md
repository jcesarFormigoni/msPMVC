# msPMVC
Very Simple mvc PERL.

MVC developed for studies of MVC architecture, using OO and requires was possible develop a MVC that runs on the Linux Command line.

Simple and easy to use and it is necessary to follow some rules already commented in the Script but I mention these details. 

`Remembering this MVC was developed to study the MVC architecture so it is very simple and I'm sure there are other ways to write it but to start is good. To whom it may concern has a good advantage` 

## Installation
`git pull https://github.com/jcesarFormigoni/msPMVC.git`
## Usage
After git pull the same is already in its basic operation I wrote three modules to test and demonstrate its use. 

1 - If you want to create your modules (obvious), it is necessary that the view needs to have exactly the same name as your modules.

2 - Remember to add in your config file module `,"moduleName",`

3 - Usage Examples :

` perl main.pl dataSearch "ToFind_by_Text"` Find by Text

` perl main.pl listUniqData "ToFind_by_id"` Find by id

` perl main.pl listBase` List all Text File Database
